        <p>
        <h2>Matsya:</h2> Matsya is the first avatar of Lord Vishnu with the upper torso of a human, and lower body with
        a fish tail. Matsya is the avatar of Vishnu as a saviour in the form of fish who saves the first man in creation
        named Manu from the flood. In Hindu mythology, it is believed that Lord Vishnu incarnated as Matsya (meaning
        fish) to save the world from heavy rain. The story of Matsya begins with a king named Manu, who was an ardent
        devotee of Vishnu. Lord Vishnu in the form of a fish instructed Manu about the impending flood, and asked him to
        build a massive boat and take along with him seeds of all plants, animals, and the seven sages. As the deluge
        began, Vishnu in the form of Matsya avatar guided the boat through the storm, and saved Manu, and all of the
        beings and seeds in the boat. When the flood receded, Manu repopulated the earth with the seeds, thus beginning
        a new cycle of creation. The essential part of Matsya avatar in Hindu Mythology also explains the battle with
        Hayagriva who stole the vedas from Brahma, where Matsya retrieved the Vedas and restored them to Brahma. Matsya
        avatar symbolizes preservation, protection, and the cyclical nature of creation and destruction.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>Kurma:</h2>Kurma is the second avatar of Lord Vishnu as a tortoise to protect the devas and asuras.
            This avatar depicts Vishnu with the upper torso of a human, and lower body as a giant tortoise. Lord Vishnu
            took the form of a Tortoise to bear the weight of the mountain Mandara, while the devas and asuras were
            churning the Ocean for Nectar of immortality. According to the Puranas, during the churning of the cosmic
            ocean, the gods and demons used Mount Mandara as a churning rod and Vasuki, the serpent king, as the rope.
            However, as the mountain began to sink, Vishnu took the form of Kurma Avatar to support the mountain on his
            back and prevent it from sinking. This helped the churning to continue and the treasures hidden in the ocean
            to be retrieved, including the nectar of immortality. The kurma avatar symbolizes wisdom, patience, a state
            of balance, and the willingness to serve others.</p>

    
            <h1 id="main-heading" class="heading-style">VARHA</h1>
            <p>
            <h2>Varaha:</h2> Varaha is the third avatar of Lord Vishnu as a boar or a giant pig protecting Mother Earth
            from the demon Hiranyaksha when he became a threat to the earth. Varaha is depicted with the face of a wild
            boar, and the torso and lower body of a human. Hiranyaksha, through his severe penance, earned a powerful
            boon from Brahma that he should be invincible against all beings. With his new power, he troubled the gods
            and celestial beings, and submerged the Mother Earth into the ocean. In order to protect the universe,
            Vishnu took the form of Varaha to rescue the earth. Varaha dived deep into the cosmic ocean and fought
            Hiranyaksha, and lifted the earth using his strong tusks, and brought it back to the surface, restoring it
            to its rightful place in the universe. The boar symbolizes strength and stability, which is proven lifting
            the earth from the cosmic ocean, and Varaha avatar symbolizes the triumph of good over evil, to protect the
            universe and maintain cosmic balance.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>Narasimha:</h2> Narasimha is the fourth avatar of Lord Vishnu depicted with a human torso and lower
            body, but with the head and claws of a lion. He primarily took this avatar to destroy the demon king
            Hiranyakashipu to protect his devotee Prahalad. Prahalad, a devoted follower of Vishnu, is the son of the
            demon king Hiranyakashipu. The demon king got a powerful boon, that states he could not be killed by any man
            or beast, indoors or outdoors, during the day or night. He became so arrogant and considered himself
            invincible, demanding that everyone worship only him as a god. But Prahalad’s steadfast devotion to Vishnu
            remained the same. The angry Hiranyakashipu tried to kill his own son, but it failed as Vishnu emerged from
            a pillar as Narasimha and protected Prahalad. In a fierce encounter, Narasimha defeated Hiranyakashipu,
            killing him at dusk, using his sharp claws. The pillar from which Narasimha emerged, the use of sharp claws,
            and killing at dusk, thus epitomized divine creativity, adhering to the conditions of Hiranyakashipu’s boon.
            Narasimha Avatar symbolizes the victory of good over evil and the protection of devotees.</p>
            <h1 id="main-heading" class="heading-style">VAMANA</h1>
            <p>
            <h2>Vamana:</h2> Lord Vishnu's fifth avatar as a brahmin dwarf of incredible intelligence and power to
            control and destroy the Asura King Mahabali who intend to control the universe. According to Hindu
            scriptures, the demon king Mahabali had gained immense power and was ruling the three worlds. The gods,
            fearing his growing power, sought Vishnu's help. Vishnu agreed to help and took the form of Vamana, a dwarf
            Brahmin. Since Mahabali was known for his generosity, Vamana approached Mahabali and asked for three spaces
            of land that would be sufficient for himself, and that he would measure the three spaces with his own feet.
            Mahabali agreed to Vamana, not knowing the original form of the dwarf. Vamana grew into an enormous size,
            and measured the earth with the first step, and sky with the second step, and for the third step, Vamana
            stood that there was no place for the third step. At this Mahabali offered his own head for Vamana to take
            the third step, thus surrendering himself to the Lord. Impressed by Mahabali's humility and devotion, Vamana
            granted him a boon to visit his kingdom once a year, and this visit is celebrated as the festival of Onam in
            Kerala, India. The Vamana Avatar symbolizes the victory of humility and righteousness over arrogance and
            power, and Vishnu's role as the preserver of dharma.</p>
